This algorithm takes two parameters as array of numbers and sum.
The algorithm will return the sum of the values in the array which is equal to the sum provided in the parameter.
GUIDELINES:
1.Result should be an array of arrays.
2.Any number in the "numArray" can be used a multiple pairs
EX: arr = [1,6,4,5,3,3] sum= 7
===> [[6,1],[3,4],[4,3]] this should be the answer.
