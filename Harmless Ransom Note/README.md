This algorithm is mainly based on:
You are given two strings(or array of words):
.One is the Note(the words that you want to write)
.Second is the magazine(the words that you can use to write your Note
You need to check:
CAN YOU BUILD THE RANSOM NOTE USING ONLY WORDS FROM THE MAGAZINE?
Each word in the magazine can be used only once.

KEYWORDS:
Time Complexity: the time an algorithm takes to run in terms of the input size.
Big O notation: the language used to express time complexity.
.0(1)= constant time(fast,doesn't grow with input size)
.0(n)= linear time(grows in propotion to the input)
.0(n^2)= quadratic time(slower,grows as the input increases)
