This is one of the most popular algorithms due to its popularity on interview questions and its performance.

.A binary search algorithm allows user to search for a given value(key) inside a list(numArray)
.Run in O(log n) run time, very performant
.Can be written as a recursion function.

RECURSION: it is when a function calles itself
To visualize what the function of the recursion was doing we used a CALL STACK
CALL STACK: It represents what order are functions are being called and in what variables they are being called with.
