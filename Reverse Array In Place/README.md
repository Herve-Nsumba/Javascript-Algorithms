This algorithm will take an array as a parameter, reverse that array and return to us the Reversed array.

An important part of this alogorithm is that we will be manipulating and reversing the array that is passed in. Not creating a new array and pushinght elements into it.

We will not loop through the array backwards and push the element into the array, not that.

===>In this case we will only work with the array that is passed in. We will see the importance of using the the temporary variable.
